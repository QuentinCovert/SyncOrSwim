Description:
   Physical meeting. Primarily discussed the Settings file used by the program and the status of the project.

Duration: 2 hours

Discussion:
- Because some global values are needed in the different modules of the program, a Settings file and cooresponding generation module is needed.
- All modules except the GUI, the Settings, and the Remote module are complete. Then all that will be needed is the main integration.
