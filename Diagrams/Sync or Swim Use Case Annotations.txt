Normal
	File Syncing
		Sync my files between local machine and server - Standard primary functionality of system. Takes a set of files, that is set to be encrypted by default, and syncs them between the FTP server, Watchman and the local machine.
		Sync a file that is not encrypted - Sets a file in the sync file set to not be encrypted when syncing occurs.
		Set files to be ignored in sync - Keeps files from being added to set of synced files. Connected to sync files because it affects the set of files that are synces
		Remove file from sync - Self explanatory. Connected to sync files because it affects the set of files that are synced.
	Non Syncing
		Generate crypto key - Create a cryptography key for use with a particular file set
		Set crypto key - Provide the cryptography key use with a particular file set; connected to Generate key because when you generate a key it is set as the key for the set of files related to the key
		Decrypt a file - Use a key to decrypt a file/file set
		Encrypt a file - Use a key to encrypt a file/file set
		Specify folders to watch - Add files to Watchman's set of watched files
		Verify User - Log in to the FTP server
Alternate
	No such file in server - User attempts to get a file that is not synced to server.
	Invalid crypto key - Key can not possibly used in encryption or decryption (Invalid format, invalid characters, etc.)
	No new changes - File has not changed and no resyncing is needed for it.
	Incorrect verification information - Incorrect verification information provided when user is being verified
Exceptional
	Local Machine shuts down unexpectedly - Server-side file integrety must be maintainable despite the possibility of power failure.
