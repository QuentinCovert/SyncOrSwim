# SyncOrSwim

A simple, fast and secure file syncing application. SyncOrSwim seeks to solve a number of problems in existing file syncing applications.
Namely, lack of support for end-to-end encryption controlled by the user on their local machine, and lack of control of where the file is placed remotely.
