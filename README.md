# ${1:Project Name}
A simple, fast, and secure file syncing application. SyncOrSwim seeks to solve a number of problems in existing file syncing applications.
Namely, lack of support for end-to-end encryption controlled locally by the user, and lack of control of where the file is placed remotely.
## ZenHub
We will be using the Chrome extension ZenHub to create and manage issue tracking for this project. As such, all major additions and changes
will be created as issues on ZenHub's and placed on the issue board. Management of issues will be primarily on an individual basis, but it
is highly encouraged to discuss with the team first on Slack before handling new or old issues.
